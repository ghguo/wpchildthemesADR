# Child Themes for Prebid.js Adapters and Google Ad Manager
 can be used to integrate Prebid.js and Google Ad Manager. 

Here are examples of two WordPress [child themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/), which provide a WordPress site Header Bidding capability with Prebid.js and Google Ad Manager. One child theme (adr folder) is for WordPress theme [Twenty Twenty-Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/). The other (adr2023 folder) is for [Twenty Twenty-Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/)

These examples show an ad in header and other ads along with content.

For your specific theme, you need to modify the child theme's style.css by replacing Template value with your theme name. You can also customize your child theme parts and function.php based on your requirements. 

To install a child theme, zip the folder, add it to your workpress site and activate it.
