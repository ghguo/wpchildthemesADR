# Child Themes for Prebid.js Adapters and Google Ad Manager
WordPress [child themes](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) can be used to integrate Prebid.js and Google Ad Manager. 

Here are examples of two child themes. One (adr folder) is for WordPress [Twenty Twenty-Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/). The other (adr2023 folder) is for [Twenty Twenty-Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/)

These examples show an ad in header and other ads along with content.

For your specific theme, you need to modify the child theme's style.css by replacing Template value to your theme name. Of course, you can customize your child themes parts and function.php based on your requirements. 

To install a child theme, zip the folder, add it to your workpress site and activate it.
